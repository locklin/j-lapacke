Lapack provides access to lapack routines.

The lapack routines are compiled from C source available
from the netlib web site. The C source was originally built
by automatic conversion from the original Fortran.

All double and complexdouble routines are in jlapack.dll.
Double routines start with d and doublecomplex routines
start with z.

The routines are called with the J DLL call mechanism as
documented in User Manual chapter "DLL's and Memory
Management".

Script covers have been written for a few routines. It is
easy add them by reading the documentation and following
the pattern in the existing ones. Use dgeev.ijs as a simple
example. Please pass back any you do so we can build up the
library.

lapack.ijs provides some common definitions.

The interface to an lapack routine is defined in a script
with the name of the routine. For example, routine dgeev is
defined in geev.ijs.

Attention needs to be paid to the Fortran column-major
order used in lapack vs the J row-major order.
